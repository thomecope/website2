        <p>
            My name is Tommy Cope and I am a Algorithm Engineer at <a href="https://www.kla.com/" target="_blank">KLA</a>. I work on finding nanometer-sized defects in semiconductors using computer vision and deep learning techniques. I attended the University of Michigan for my undergrad and master’s, studying electrical and computer engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also previously a professional swimmer and a member of the US Men’s National Team and the DC Trident in the <a href="https://isl.global" target="_blank">International Swimming League</a>. Before turning pro, I swam at <a href="https://mgoblue.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/tommy-cope/19169" target="_blank">Michigan</a>, where I was team captain, Big Ten Champion, school record holder, and <a href="https://ece.engin.umich.edu/stories/cope-reflects-on-b1g-medal-of-honor-stepping-up-to-continue-u-m-swimming-legacy" target="_blank">Big Ten Medal of Honor</a> recipient.
