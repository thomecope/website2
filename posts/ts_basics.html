        <h1>Why semiconductors?</h1>
        <p>
            Here is my first attempt to explain what semiconductors actually are and how we go from silicon to the iPhone.

        <ol>
            <li>Semiconductors are a group of elements (such as silicon) that have electrical conductivity that can be manipulated.</li>
            <li>Silicon can be assembled into devices called transistors. Transistors are like a switch: they receive an input that either allows electricity to flow through or stop it.</li>
